## Overview

You can use `generator.py` to generate a CSV file containing comparisons between images. The script will produce a CSV file with the following columns:

- `session_id`: A unique identifier for the session (you can specify the number of sessions to generate in the script).
- `image1`: The name of the first image.
- `image2`: The name of the second image.

To use the script, provide a list of images in the `sample.txt` file. You can also configure the number of repetitions for each image pair and the number of attention checks per session. Comparisons are generated by sampling images with probabilities inversely proportional to the total number of times they have already been selected. 

Once generated, the CSV file can be used for the [experiment](https://github.com/Complexity-Project/Experiment). You have to put it in the `images/` folder.


Once the experiment is complete, you have to store all the csv files in the `data/` folder. You can then run the first cell of `data_reader.ipynb` to generate probability matrix and id-to-index mapping in `npz` format. Then you can run the `bradley_choix.py` script to generate the final rankings using [Bradley-Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model). The script will output the final rankings in a CSV file. 

You can use the second cell of `data_reader.ipynb` to count the attention checks from the experiment.
